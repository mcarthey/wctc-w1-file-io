# Introduction to C#
## Overview of C# and Console Applications

---

### What is C#?
- C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language developed by Microsoft.
- It is part of the .NET framework, making it versatile for various types of applications.

---

### Basics of C# Programming

#### Variables and Data Types
- **Variables** store data to be referenced and manipulated in programs.
- Common **data types** include `int`, `string`, `bool`, and `double`.

#### Operators
- **Arithmetic operators** (+, -, *, /)
- **Comparison operators** (==, !=, >, <)
- **Logical operators** (&&, ||, !)

---

### Control Structures

#### Decision Making
- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statements

#### Loops
- `for`: Iterates a set number of times.
- `foreach`: Iterates over items in a collection.
- `while`: Continues as long as a condition is true.
- `do while`: Similar to `while`, but checks condition after the loop.

---

### Collections in C#

#### Arrays
- Fixed size, same data type collection.
  
#### Lists
- Dynamic size, same data type collection.
- Part of `System.Collections.Generic`.

---

### Functions in C#
- Encapsulate reusable code blocks.
- Can return a value or be void.

---

### Exception Handling
- `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks handle exceptions.
- Ensures graceful handling of runtime errors.

---

### File I/O Operations
- Reading and writing files is essential for data management.
- `System.IO` namespace provides tools for file operations.

```csharp
using System.IO;

string text = File.ReadAllText("file.txt");
File.WriteAllText("output.txt", text);
```
